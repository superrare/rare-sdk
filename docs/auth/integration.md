# Cross-repository acceptance

Run from the SDK checkout with Node 24, a built SDK, a built auth service, `psql`,
and `redis-server`. These commands are explicitly opt-in and are not part of the
ordinary unit suite. No production endpoints or database may be used.

## Real dependencies

The gate calls the built SDK, real authority HTTP routes and device bridge, real
Rare API HTTP routes, and gql-api backed by migrated Postgres. The auth launcher uses the actual shared Fastify server (legacy plus v2 routes) and
real Redis against a newly launched disposable Redis process. It generates only
temporary service credentials and the legacy JWT secret; v2 needs no signing keys.
Stopping it destroys all test sessions. EOA signing uses a new
random in-memory wallet on each run. No real wallet or social-provider credentials
are needed.

The runner does **not** supply a fake account resolver or mock GraphQL responses.
Start the actual backend account services first (or a backend-owned narrow server
that mounts the real routes, GraphQL resolver/service, service guard and persistent
database). Configure any publisher dependencies with their real local emulators.
Using an in-memory account map or mocked GraphQL transport does not satisfy this
gate.

## Environment and commands

Supply paths and test-only secrets through the environment. The harness contains
no developer-specific checkout paths. Generate three different random secrets
locally and share them between backend and authority configuration; do not commit
them or paste credential values into test reports.

```sh
export RARE_CROSS_REPO=1
export CROSS_AUTH_WORKTREE=/absolute/path/to/auth-worktree
export CROSS_AUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3031/auth/v2
export CROSS_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3032
export CROSS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test_user:test_password@127.0.0.1:5433/sdk_acceptance
# Also set CROSS_PROVISION_SECRET, CROSS_INTROSPECTION_SECRET,
# and CROSS_BRIDGE_SECRET to distinct random values (at least 32 characters).
# Optional executable overrides: PSQL_BIN and REDIS_SERVER_BIN.

npm run build
node test/cross-repo/authority.mjs
```

Run the last command in its own terminal. It prints `READY` only after the actual
authority listens. It requires the auth checkout's root `build/` output from `npm run build`
and installed root dependencies. Stop it with Ctrl-C when finished.

The backend must use `CROSS_DATABASE_URL` and these matching settings:

- Provisioning credential: `CROSS_PROVISION_SECRET`.
- Introspection issuer: `CROSS_AUTH_URL`; audience: `CROSS_API_URL`.
- Confidential introspection client: `rare-api`; secret:
  `CROSS_INTROSPECTION_SECRET`.
- Account provisioning at `/internal/v1/accounts/resolve` and GET/PATCH `/v1/me`.
- Actual authenticated GraphQL transport to the account resolver.

With the backend listening and the same environment in another terminal:

```sh
node test/cross-repo/run.mjs
```

Alternatively, the reusable local composition launcher starts both the authority
and actual Rare API, generates matching ephemeral service credentials, runs the
gate, then stops only the processes it launched. First start the backend-owned
GraphQL harness with real Postgres and Pub/Sub as documented in the monorepo's
`docs/sdk-auth-delivery.md`. Supply its generated private environment file:

```sh
export CROSS_MONOREPO_WORKTREE=/absolute/path/to/superrare-monorepo-worktree
export CROSS_BACKEND_ENV_FILE=/absolute/path/to/sdk-account-harness.env
# CROSS_DATABASE_URL must match the backend database. Its schema query parameter
# is supported, or set CROSS_DATABASE_SCHEMA explicitly (default: public).
# Optional: test the actual built CLI as well, with isolated file storage:
export CROSS_CLI_WORKTREE=/absolute/path/to/rare-cli-worktree
node test/cross-repo/local-stack.mjs
```

The earlier `RARE_CROSS_REPO`, `CROSS_AUTH_WORKTREE`, `CROSS_AUTH_URL`,
`CROSS_API_URL`, and `CROSS_DATABASE_URL` variables are also required. This launcher
generates the three service secrets itself; they need not be exported. It uses
`pnpm` (`PNPM_BIN` can override its executable) and the backend test environment
template. An already running GraphQL service is required; it does not create or
migrate the database. The provided API port overrides the backend harness default.

The optional CLI gate requires the built CLI's explicit `--auth-directory` support.
It starts device login without opening a browser, approves the code using the real
bridge, resumes login in another CLI process, verifies status, reads/updates the
profile, then logs out. It uses a new private temporary storage directory and
explicit file storage; it never changes HOME or accesses the native keychain.

## Assertions and result semantics

The runner verifies:

1. Wallet login creates exactly one real Postgres account/address binding.
2. SDK profile reads and writes match persisted data.
3. A separate login reuses that account and preserves its profile.
4. Null profile patches clear fields.
5. Explicit SDK refresh rotates credentials and the actual API accepts the result.
6. Logout makes both previous and refreshed access tokens immediately unauthorized,
   while a separate installation remains authorized.
7. Device review and a fresh review-bound wallet signature, followed by SDK polling
   at its actual cadence, resolve to the same persisted account.
8. Revoking the device session makes its access token unauthorized.

Tokens, private keys, service secrets, and device codes are never printed. Database
credentials are passed to `psql` via its environment rather than command arguments.
The gate revokes sessions and deletes only the newly generated wallet's account
rows. Always use an isolated disposable database because real publication can
produce downstream effects outside those rows.

- Exit **0** and final `PASS`: the assertions completed.
- Exit **2** and `UNAVAILABLE`: prerequisites or reachable local services are missing;
  this is not a skipped success or a completed acceptance gate.
- Exit **1** and `FAIL`: a runtime assertion/operation failed after preflight.

This gate deliberately exercises the private bridge directly. It does not establish
browser CSRF/UI behavior, social-provider account continuity, deployed configuration,
smart-wallet RPC verification, or CLI OS-keychain behavior; those require their
separate gates. Do not describe this result as proof of those behaviors.

## Recorded local evidence

The core gate passed against actual implementations on 2026-09-24: wallet account
creation, profile persistence and account reuse, refresh rotation, immediate family
revocation with another installation preserved, and fresh-signature device approval
all passed; process exit was 0. The backend used its actual AccountModule, GraphQL
service guard, Postgres schema with all existing migrations, and a real Pub/Sub
emulator. The authority used the real Redis adapter against disposable Redis.

A subsequent full run with `CROSS_CLI_WORKTREE` also exited 0: actual CLI subprocess
device login/resume, remotely verified status, profile read/update through stdin,
logout and signed-out status all passed using isolated file storage. The test
confirmed the CLI's profile write directly in Postgres and reran every core assertion.

Syntax checks and ESLint passed for the harness. Missing opt-in was separately
verified to return exit 2 (`UNAVAILABLE`). The shared auth service now uses Node 24 without a separate provider runtime.

After consolidation, the full gate passed again with the actual shared legacy/v2 Fastify server and opaque tokens, including all CLI subprocess checks. Public SDK/CLI methods and Connect approval requests required no behavioral change.
